# Overwatch Rank Tracker

It is a desktop application that allows you to track the rank(s) and stats in **Competitive Role Queue** for one or multiple accounts.

**IMPORTANT: the app only runs on Windows and only tracks PC statistics.**

The displayed information will only be shown if the account is not set to private and the player has participated in Competitive Role Queue at least once. Otherwise, the status will be indicated as Private/Limited.

**Limited** - profile is public, but there are no statistics on rating in it.  
Column **"Season"** displays the last season in which the player played.
